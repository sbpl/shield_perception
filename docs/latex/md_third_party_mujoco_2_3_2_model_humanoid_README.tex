Degrees of Freedom\+: 27 Actuators\+: 21

This simplified humanoid model, introduced in \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}, is designed for bipedal locomotion behaviours. While several variants of it exist in the wild, this version is based on the model in the Deep\+Mind Control Suite \mbox{[}2\mbox{]}, which has fairly realistic actuator gains.
