{\ttfamily simulate} is a fully-\/featured interactive application for Mu\+Jo\+Co. It opens an Open\+GL window using the platform-\/independent GLFW library, and renders the simulation state in it. There is built-\/in help, simulation statistics, profiler, sensor data plots. The model file can be specified as a command-\/line argument, or loaded at runtime using drag-\/and-\/drop functionality. Below is a screen-\/capture of simulate in action\+:
